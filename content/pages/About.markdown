title: About

Hey! My name is Jason Osajima. 

I started off as a Japanese taiko player and now I am a Data Scientist working at Disney ABC Television. One of my projects was to research and deploy the first recommender system used by the ABC app. 

Iâ€™m also a Graduate Student at UCLA in Applied Statistics.
